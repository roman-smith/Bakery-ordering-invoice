# Bakery-ordering-invoice
Class: CSE 205 - Assignment: 1
Description: I wrote this Java program for my CSE 205 class. The program facilitates the ordering of food from a bakery using the command-line interface. The program first asks the user to choose whether they would like to manually process an order or read an order from a file. To manually process an order, the program presents the user with a menu and writes each order to an invoice text file (called invoice.txt) using file output until the user indicates that they are finished ordering. To read an order from the file, the program uses file input to process each item listed in the file (order.txt and order2.txt are sample orders) and then writes each item ordered to an invoice text file (the invoice.txt file in this repository is the invoice generated by the order.txt file). The subtotal price, tax, and total price are calculated and added to the invoice file.
